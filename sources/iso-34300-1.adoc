== Role of the ISO 34300/AG

An advisory group (ISO 34300/AG) has been appointed to ensure the
operations of the registration authority (ISO 34300/RA) are in accordance
with guidelines provided in this document.

== Composition of the ISO 34300/AG

=== Voting members

==== General

The ISO 34300/AG voting membership consists of:

* ISO 34300/AG Convenor
* ISO 34300/AG Vice-Convenor

* at least 10 to 17 individually named members representing voting member bodies
as follows:

** five to eight standing members from international organizations other than
ISO;

** five standing members from within ISO/TC 154 participating member bodies
(P-members);

** four (maximum) rotating members from within ISO/TC 154 participating member
bodies (P-members).

ISO/TC 154 should review the membership structure of the ISO 34300/AG at regular
intervals to ensure that its members fulfil their obligations (see 4.1).

Recommendations for changes to the structure shall be submitted to ISO/TC 154
for consideration and, if approved, will be implemented by the time of the next
plenary meeting.

The ISO 34300/AG membership list is available on the ISO 34300/AG ISO Documents
website.


==== International organization (other than ISO) standing members

A minimum of five and not more than eight international organizations that are
not within ISO may be appointed to ISO 34300/AG.

These international organizations are selected based on the role that they can
play in achieving the greatest use and promotion of ISO 34300. These
international organizations are appointed by ISO/TC 154 as standing members.
These international organizations are required to be existing
Category A liaisons to ISO/TC 154.

==== ISO P-members

===== Standing ISO P-members

Five standing P-members may be appointed to consecutive terms in the ISO
34300/AG. These members should reflect the greatest responsibility and
productivity within the technical committee structure for this purpose. The
P-members are selected by ISO/TC 154 for three-year periods which can be renewed
automatically for consecutive terms. The composition of the standing members is
established by ISO/TC 154.


===== Rotating ISO P-members

Any P-members from ISO/TC 154 who are not standing members may apply to be a
rotating P-member of ISO 34300/AG. ISO/TC 154 selects up to four P-members
amongst the candidates taking into account the following considerations.

* Up to four rotating P-members may sit on the ISO 34300/AG at one time.
* Each year, two new members are selected for a period of two years, and two
members (who have completed their two-year membership) leave the ISO 34300/AG.

NOTE: Members leaving the ISO 34300/AG may be re-elected an indefinite number of
times. It is recognised that all willing P-members have an opportunity to serve
on the ISO 34300/AG.

* Members should be selected in view of the best linguistic diversity and
geographical representation, for example amongst:

** African states,

** Asia and Pacific states,

** European states,

** North and South American states.

* Where insufficient nominations are received, the relevant number of seats on
the ISO 34300/AG may remain unassigned.

At the first election, four members will be elected, of which two will serve two
years before leaving and being replaced whilst the other two will serve three
years before leaving and being replaced. Those leaving after two years shall be
selected by the drawing of lots.


=== Non-voting members

==== Associate members

At the proposal of the Secretary-General of ISO, other ISO/TC 154 P-members and
international organizations may be associated with the work of the ISO 34300/RA.

An associate member body has the same status as an ordinary member but does not
participate in voting.

==== Members for information

These members of the ISO 34300/RA are non-voting members participating directly
or indirectly in the maintenance of ISO 34300.


== Secretariat of the ISO 34300/AG

The ISO 34300/AG is served by a secretariat (ISO 34300/AGS), as designated by
the ISO Council.


== Responsibilities of ISO 34300/AG members

=== Voting members

Voting member bodies shall have one vote each and shall nominate within their
respective organizations:

* one person to act as the representative voting member;
* one person to act as a substitute to its representative in case of
unavailability.

These representatives should preferably be chosen to have the expertise
necessary to understand ISO 34300 issues.

The ISO 34300/RA shall decide upon additions to and deletions from the list of country and country-subdivision code elements in ISO 34300 under conditions specified in Clause 5, and upon the assignment , reservation alteration or deletion of code elements. Members are expected to vote, respond and comment without delay within specified time limits on ISO 34300/RA matters and attend meetings of the ISO 34300/RA, as required.


Members that recurrently fail to perform these duties will be reminded by the ISO 34300/AGS of their obligations. However, in the event that the member repeatedly fails to respond, it may result in the downgrade or removal of the member, e.g. downgraded to an Associate Member.



=== ISO 34300/AGS

The ISO 34300/AGS is responsible for the administration of maintenance
procedures, including updating and maintaining the ISO 34300/AG membership list;
calling meetings of ISO 34300/AG voting and/or non-voting members when
necessary, preparing meeting agendas and providing the minutes from meetings;

* voting procedures;
* preparation of material for external contacts;
* advice to users regarding application of the set of the officially assigned
  ISO 34300 code elements;
* publication and dissemination of results of the maintenance procedures.

The ISO3166/AGS is also responsible for maintaining an efficient arrangement
concerning communication and documentation to ISO 34300/AG members and other
interested parties. On behalf of the ISO 34300/AG members and without affecting
the functions of the ISO-SG, the ISO 34300/AGS may contact governmental
organizations, non-governmental organizations and experts at a working level
when needed for the advancement of ISO 34300.


=== Officers of the ISO 34300/AG

The ISO 34300/AGS in coordination with the ISO/TC 154 Secretariat shall nominate
a permanent Chair and Vice-chair to be the officers of the ISO 34300/AG.

These two officers shall be representatives of the two different membership
groups:

* one from the ISO P-members;

* one from non-ISO international organizations.

These nominations will be submitted to ISO/TC 154 for approval.

When necessary, the vice-convenor replaces the convenor and assumes their
responsibilities.

In accordance with ISO's neutrality policy, the convenor will not have a vote on
ISO 34300/AG matters. Therefore, if the appointment of the convenor leaves a
voting member vacancy from one of its member bodies, the member body shall name
a new member to the ISO 34300/AG.

After the appointment of new officers, the outgoing and incoming officers should
ensure a smooth and efficient handling of the work with the support of the ISO
34300/AGS during a transitional period.


== Working procedure

=== Principles

The maintenance procedure shall be as expedient as possible. It generally
functions by means of communication technologies. When any of the ISO 34300/AG
voting members or the ISO-SG consider that a meeting is required, the ISO
34300/AGS consults the ISO 34300/AG members about the convening of such a
meeting.

As a general principle, to ensure continuity and stability in the system, code
elements shall be changed only for compelling reasons.

=== Consultation

Before opening any vote, a consultation period of at least ten working days
shall be conducted amongst the ISO 34300/AG members. ISO 34300/AG members are
invited to provide comments concerning the subject of consultation during this
period. Based on findings from this consultation, a vote may be initiated.


=== Voting procedures

Each voting member of the ISO 34300/AG shall have one vote (see 2.1). Votes
shall be cast by the nominated representative or the substitute of each voting
member. Members shall actively cast their votes, i.e. yes, no or abstention.

Agreement on proposed changes shall be obtained by means of communication
technologies or at a meeting of the ISO 34300/AG, provided that the matter has
been included in the draft agenda of the meeting.

In cases of urgency, the ISO 34300/AGS may obtain the agreement on the proposed
changes from the members of the ISO 34300/AG by remote communication; these
agreements shall be confirmed in writing.

The length of the reply period shall be six working days but at the request of
the Convenor or at least one ISO 34300/RA voting member, the reply period may be
extended. For the purposes of the ISO 34300/RA, the term "working days" shall
exclude Saturdays and Sundays. The term "working days" shall also exclude the
last five days of December.

The vote will only be approved if there is a two-thirds majority and at least
eight positive votes.

When there is a two-thirds majority of positive votes, but fewer than eight
positive votes because of the high number of abstentions, a second round of
voting is held. After the second round, there will be no further ballots on the
same proposal. Recorded abstentions do not count. Voting members not fulfilling
their responsibilities by casting an active vote will be reminded of their
responsibilities (see 4.1).


== Publication and dissemination of information

=== Updating of ISO 34300

After approval by the members of the ISO 34300/AG, the ISO 34300/RA will update
and publish the appropriate registrations, with all agreed corrections, if any.

The ISO 34300/AGS may consult individual ISO 34300/AG members directly
concerning particular problems of implementation raised by users or potential
users.


=== Advice to users and promotion of ISO 34300

Subject to these Terms of Reference and in consultation with the ISO-SG, the ISO
34300/AGS acts as a centre for the reception, storage and dissemination of
information relevant to users and potential users of ISO 34300, thereby seeking
to promote its widest possible use.

The ISO 34300/AG is also available for consultation and assistance on the use of
codes for calendar systems and calendar eras.


[appendix]
== Maintenance procedures for registration items

=== Operations on list of calendar systems and calendar eras and their codes

==== General process

The terms of reference provided in this document applies to the maintenance of
ISO 34300.

Upon a request for changing a registration item, the procedure
for treating such requests is the following.

. The ISO 34300/AG verifies that the request is supported by justification
meeting all of the criteria.

. The ISO 34300/AG initiates a consultation of its members about the proposed
update and possible changes necessary.

. Following the consultation, the ISO 34300/AG voting members are asked to vote
on the change.

.. If ISO 34300/AG voting confirms adoption of the change, the change proceeds.

.. Otherwise, the request is rejected and the party that made the request
informed.


[[registration-adding-tzauth]]
==== Registration of a new calendar system and calendar era

Additions to the list of calendar systems and calendar eras shall be made on the
basis of information from upon the request of a member of ISO 34300/AG.

A calendar system is eligible for registration if it meets the requirements
stated in ISO 34300.
// <<scsa-requirements>>.

NOTE: Meeting the criteria is necessary for consideration but might not be
sufficient for inclusion in ISO 34300.

The proposer is responsible for providing justification to the ISO 34300/AG
regarding the eligibility of such addition.

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the addition, on the basis of eligibility and
usage justification.

Code elements will be allocated by the ISO 34300/AG at its discretion.

Since a calendar system requires at least one calendar era, the application and
assignment of calendar system and calendar era codes can be performed at once.


////
Additions to the official and international time scale authorities require additional criteria:

* An official time scale authority must be endorsed by a body receiving direct authority by a member of the United Nations.
* An international time scale authority must be endorsed by an international standardization body in liaison with the ISO 34300/AG.
////

==== Modification of a calendar system or calendar era code

Modifications of a code within the list of calendar systems and calendar eras
shall be made upon the request of a member of ISO 34300/AG.

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the modification, on the basis of the
information received.

The previously assigned code is reserved after modification for
backwards-compatibility purposes.


[[registration-removing-tzauth]]
=== Removal from the list of calendar system and calendar era codes

Removal of a code from the list of calendar systems and calendar eras shall be made upon the request of a member of ISO 34300/AG.

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the deletion, on the basis of the information received. The corresponding code element is reserved.



[[registration-deleting-tz]]
=== Removal of elements from the list of calendar system and calendar era codes

Deletion from the list of calendar system and calendar era codes shall be made only by the ISO 34300/AG or upon a request to it.

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the deletion, on the basis of the information received. The corresponding code element is reserved.



[[registration-modify-tz]]
=== Alterations to elements on list of calendar system and calendar era codes

Alterations to a registered element shall be made only by the ISO 34300/AG or upon a request to it.

A significant change of name may require the ISO 34300/AG to change the alpha code element concerned. The ISO 34300/AG, however, shall endeavor to maintain stability in the list of code elements.



[[reservation]]
=== Reservation of code elements

==== Introduction

Some code elements are reserved:

* for a limited period when their reservation is the result of
  the deprecation (<<registration-removing-tzauth>>) or the alteration (<<registration-modify-tz>>)
  of an entry;

* for an indeterminate period when the reservation is the result of
  the application of international law or of
  exceptional requests (<<reservation-exceptional>>).

==== Period of non-allocation

Code elements that the ISO 34300/AG has altered or deleted should not be reallocated during a period of at least ten years after the change.

The exact period is determined in each case on the basis of the extent to which the former code element was used.


[[reservation-exceptional]]
==== Exceptional reservations

Code elements may be reserved, in exceptional cases, for calendar systems and
calendar eras which the ISO 34300/AG has decided not to include in the lists
maintained by ISO 34300/RA, but for which an interchange or encoding requirement
exists.

==== Reallocation

Before reallocating a former code element or a formerly reserved code element,
the ISO 34300/AG shall consult, as appropriate, the authority or agency on whose
behalf the code element was reserved, and consideration shall be given to
difficulties which might arise from the reallocation.


==== User-assigned code elements

ISO 34300/RA and ISO 34300/AG do not keep a record of the notifications
concerning user-assigned code elements received.


==== List of reserved code elements

A list of reserved code elements is kept by the ISO 34300/RA.
