== ISO 34300 registration authority

=== General

ISO has designated a Registration Authority for this International Standard (ISO
34300/RA) to operate under guidelines provided in this document.

ISO 34300 defines the ISO 34300 register, which contains ISO 34300 registration
items. Requirements of the ISO 34300 registration item and relevant data models
used to represent calendars and calendar eras are also provided in the same
document.

=== Responsibilities

==== Maintenance of the ISO 34300 register

The ISO 34300/RA is responsible for the maintenance of the ISO 34300 register,
including code assignments for individual registration items and the information
associated with each.

The ISO 34300/RA is also responsible for administering reservations of the codes
in the register.

==== Handling data change requests for the ISO 34300 register

ISO 34300/RA is responsible for receiving and reviewing applications for
data change requests, including the addition, modification and elimination of
registration items within the ISO 34300 register.

It is responsible for informing the applicant of the
result of ISO 34300/RA actions.

It shall propose a practical mechanism to apply the proposed change assignment
when the relevant criteria are met according to ISO 34300.

After approval by the members of the ISO 34300/AG, the ISO 34300/RA will update
and publish the appropriate registrations, with all agreed corrections, if any.

Data changes performed to the ISO 34300 register should be kept for
traceability.

==== Publisher of ISO 34300 register

ISO 34300/RA is responsible for disseminating the contents of the ISO 34300
register to the public.

Changes to the content of the list of entries becomes effective immediately upon
publication.

The ISO 34300/AGS may consult individual ISO 34300/AG members directly
concerning particular problems of implementation raised by users or potential
users.

Data changes of the ISO 34300 register should be published and the history of
changes made available.


==== Advice to users of the ISO 34300 register

ISO 34300/RA is responsible for providing advice to the public and ISO member
bodies on the application, use and implementation of ISO 34300, thereby seeking
to promote its widest possible use.


=== Other responsibilities

Other responsibilities of the ISO 34300/RA include:

. indicate in operations that it has been designated as ISO 34300/RA by ISO;
. provide an annual summary report on activity to ISO/TC 154.

// 34300/MA
// In developing ISO 34300, consideration was given to the maintenance of ISO 34300 and the // use of the codes contained therein.
// Provision was made in ISO 34300 and by the ISO Council for a Maintenance Agency (ISO 34300/// RA) with the following functions:
// a) to add and to eliminate country and country subdivision names and to assign code // elements as needed, in accordance with the rules provided in ISO 34300;
// b) to advise users regarding the application of the codes;
// c) to update and disseminate lists of country and country subdivision names, code elements // and their definitions;
// d) to maintain a reference list of all country and country subdivision code elements used // and their period of use;
// e) to publish updates announcing changes to the ISO 34300 in accordance with a);
// f) to administer the reservation of country or subdivision code elements.


== ISO 34300 advisory group

=== General

The ISO 34300 advisory group (ISO 34300/AG) is appointed to ensure the
operations of the registration authority (ISO 34300/RA) are in accordance
with guidelines provided in this document.

=== Responsibilities

The ISO 34300/AG is responsible for providing guidance to ISO 34300/RA on
handling of updates and data changes to the ISO 34300 register.

It is also responsible for providing consultation and assistance on the use of
ISO 34300 to ISO member bodies.


=== Voting members

==== General

The ISO 34300/AG voting membership consists of:

* ISO 34300/AG convenor (no vote)
* ISO 34300/AG vice-convenor

* at least 6 to 12 individually named members representing voting member bodies
as follows:

** three to six standing members from international organizations other than
ISO;

** three standing members from within ISO/TC 154 participating member bodies
(P-members);

** three (maximum) rotating members from within ISO/TC 154 participating member
bodies (P-members).

ISO/TC 154 should review the membership structure of the ISO 34300/AG at regular
intervals to ensure that its members fulfil their obligations
(<<ag-member-responsibilities>>).

Recommendations for changes to the structure shall be submitted to ISO/TC 154
for consideration and, if approved, will be implemented by the time of the next
plenary meeting.

The ISO 34300/AG membership list is available on the ISO 34300/AG ISO Documents
website.


==== International organization (other than ISO) standing members

A minimum of three and not more than six international organizations that are
not within ISO may be appointed to ISO 34300/AG.

These international organizations are selected based on the role that they can
play in achieving the greatest use and promotion of ISO 34300. These
international organizations are appointed by ISO/TC 154 as standing members.
These international organizations are required to be existing Category A
liaisons to ISO/TC 154.

==== ISO P-members

===== Standing ISO P-members

Three standing P-members may be appointed to consecutive terms in the ISO
34300/AG. These members should reflect the greatest responsibility and
productivity within the technical committee structure for this purpose. The
P-members are selected by ISO/TC 154 for three-year periods which can be renewed
automatically for consecutive terms. The composition of the standing members is
established by ISO/TC 154.


===== Rotating ISO P-members

Any P-members from ISO/TC 154 who are not standing members may apply to be a
rotating P-member of ISO 34300/AG. ISO/TC 154 selects up to four P-members
amongst the candidates taking into account the following considerations.

* Up to three rotating P-members may sit on the ISO 34300/AG at one time.
* The membership term of a rotating P-member is 2 years.

NOTE: Members leaving the ISO 34300/AG may be re-elected an indefinite number of
times. It is recognised that all willing P-members have an opportunity to serve
on the ISO 34300/AG.

* Members should be selected in view of the best cultural diversity and
geographical representation, for example amongst:

** African states,

** Asia and Pacific states,

** European states,

** North and South American states.

* Where insufficient nominations are received, the relevant number of seats on
the ISO 34300/AG may remain unassigned.

At the first election, three members will be elected, of which two will serve
two years before leaving and being replaced whilst the other one will serve
three years before leaving and being replaced. Those leaving after two years
shall be selected by the drawing of lots.


=== Non-voting members

==== Associate members

At the acceptance of ISO 34300/AG, non-members of ISO/TC 154 P-members and
international organizations may be associated with the work of the ISO 34300/AG.

An associate member body has the same status as a voting member but does not
participate in voting.

==== Members for information

These members of the ISO 34300/RA are non-voting members participating directly
or indirectly in the maintenance of ISO 34300.

==== Secretariat

The ISO 34300/AG is served by a secretariat (ISO 34300/AGS), as designated by
ISO 34300/AG.


[[ag-member-responsibilities]]
=== Member responsibilities

==== Voting members

Voting members shall have one vote each and shall nominate within their
respective organizations:

* one person to act as the representative voting member;
* one person to act as a substitute to its representative in case of
unavailability.

These representatives should preferably be chosen to have the expertise
necessary to understand ISO 34300 issues.

The ISO 34300/AG shall decide upon changes to registration items in the ISO
34300 register under conditions specified in ISO 34300.

Members are expected to vote, respond and comment without delay within specified
time limits on ISO 34300/AG matters and attend meetings of the ISO 34300/AG, as
required.

// Members that recurrently fail to perform these duties will be reminded by the
// ISO 34300/AGS of their obligations. However, in the event that the member
// repeatedly fails to respond, it may result in the downgrade or removal of the
// member, e.g. downgraded to an Associate Member.


==== Officers

Officers of the ISO 34300/AG include its convenor and vice-convenor. Both roles
are nominated by ISO/TC 154.

These two officers shall be representatives of the two different membership
groups:

* one from the ISO P-members;

* one from non-ISO international organizations.

These nominations will be submitted to ISO/TC 154 for approval.

When necessary, the vice-convenor replaces the convenor and assumes their
responsibilities.

In accordance with ISO's neutrality policy, the convenor will not have a vote on
ISO 34300/AG matters. Therefore, if the appointment of the convenor leaves a
voting member vacancy from one of its member bodies, the member body shall name
a new member to the ISO 34300/AG.

After the appointment of new officers, the outgoing and incoming officers should
ensure a smooth and efficient handling of the work with the support of the ISO
34300/AGS during a transitional period.


==== Secretariat

The ISO 34300/AGS is responsible for the administration of maintenance
procedures of ISO 34300/AG, including:

* updating and maintaining the ISO 34300/AG membership list;
* calling meetings of ISO 34300/AG voting and/or non-voting members when
necessary;
* preparing meeting agendas and providing the minutes from meetings;
* consensus procedures and their reporting.

The ISO 34300/AGS is also responsible for maintaining an efficient arrangement
concerning communication and documentation to ISO 34300/AG members and other
interested parties.


== Working procedure

=== Principles

The maintenance procedure shall be as expedient as possible. It generally
functions by means of communication technologies. When any of the ISO 34300/AG
voting members consider that a meeting is required, the ISO 34300/AGS consults
the ISO 34300/AG members about the convening of such a meeting.

As a general principle, to ensure continuity and stability in the system, code
elements shall be changed only for compelling reasons.

=== Consultation phase and procedure

Before opening any vote, a consultation period of at least ten working days
shall be conducted amongst the ISO 34300/AG members.

ISO 34300/AG members are invited to provide comments concerning the subject of
consultation during this period.

Based on findings from this consultation, the consensus phase may be initiated.

=== Consensus phase and procedure

Each voting member of the ISO 34300/AG shall have one vote. Votes
shall be cast by the nominated representative or the substitute of each voting
member. Members shall actively cast their votes, i.e. yes, no or abstention.

Agreement to proposed changes shall be obtained by means of remote communication
or at a meeting of the ISO 34300/AG, provided that the matter has been included
in the draft agenda of the meeting. These agreements shall be confirmed in
writing.

The length of the reply period shall be six working days but at the request of
the Convenor or at least one ISO 34300/RA voting member, the reply period may be
extended.

For the purposes of the ISO 34300/RA and ISO 34300/AG, the term "working days"
shall exclude Saturdays and Sundays. The term "working days" shall also exclude
the last five days of December.

Positive consensus is confirmed once there is a two-thirds majority and at least
eight positive votes.

When there is a two-thirds majority of positive votes, but fewer than four
positive votes because of the high number of abstentions, a second round of
voting is held.

After the second round, there will be no further ballots on the same proposal.

Recorded abstentions do not count. Voting members not fulfilling
their responsibilities by casting an active vote will be reminded of their
responsibilities.

=== Reporting

ISO 34300/AG is responsible for communicating data change decisions to
the ISO 34300/RA.


[appendix]
== Maintenance procedures for the ISO 34300 register

=== General

The maintenance of the ISO 34300 register follows the following criteria:

* requirements and procedures provided by this document;

* registration operations shall adhere to the requirements stated in
<<ISO19135-1>>, in which purpose ISO 34300/AG takes the role of "`Control Body`"
in the concept system of <<ISO19135-1>>;

* requirements provided in <<change-requests>> and <<reservation>>.

[[change-requests]]
=== Change requests

==== General

Requests for additions, deletions, and changes of registration items
are received by ISO 34300/RA.

The proposer is responsible for providing justification regarding the
eligibility of such change.

The procedure for treating such requests is as follows:

. ISO 34300/RA verifies that the request is supported by justification meeting
the necessary eligibility criteria.
+
NOTE: Meeting the criteria is necessary for consideration but might not be
sufficient for inclusion in ISO 34300.

. ISO 34300/RA initiates a consultation in ISO 34300/AG about the proposed
update and possible changes necessary. When ISO 34300/RA consults ISO 34300/AG
about the proposed inclusion, deletion or change, and proposes a mechanism to
implement such change, ISO 34300/AG is obliged to respond within one month.

. Following the consultation, ISO 34300/AG decides through the defined consensus
procedure whether the requested change is to be applied.

.. If ISO 34300/AG confirms the adoption of the change, the change will be
implemented by the ISO 34300/RA.

.. Otherwise, the request is rejected and the party that made the request
informed.

[[registration-adding-calauth]]
==== Registration of a new calendar system and calendar era

A calendar system and calendar era is eligible for registration if it meets the
requirements stated in ISO 34300.

// <<scsa-requirements>>.

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the addition, on the basis of eligibility and
usage justification.

Code elements will be allocated by the ISO 34300/AG at its discretion.

Since a calendar system requires at least one calendar era, the application and
assignment of calendar system and calendar era codes can be performed at once.

==== Modification of a calendar system or calendar era code

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the modification, on the basis of the
information received.

The previously assigned code is reserved after modification for
backwards-compatibility purposes.

[[registration-removing-calauth]]
==== Removal of a calendar system or a calendar era code

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the deletion, on the basis of the information
received.

The corresponding code element is reserved.

[[registration-modify-cal]]
==== Modification of associated data elements to registered calendar systems and calendar era codes

The ISO 34300/AG will decide upon the proposed modification based on information
received.

A significant change of name may require the ISO 34300/AG to change the code of
the registered element concerned. The ISO 34300/AG, however, shall endeavor to
maintain stability in the list of codes.


[[reservation]]
=== Reservation of code elements

==== General

Some code elements are reserved:

* for a limited period when their reservation is the result of
  the deprecation (<<registration-removing-calauth>>) or the
  alteration (<<registration-modify-cal>>) of an entry;

* for an indeterminate period when the reservation is the result of
  the application of international law or of
  exceptional requests (<<reservation-exceptional>>).

==== Period of non-allocation

Code elements that the ISO 34300/AG has altered or deleted should not be
reallocated during a period of at least ten years after the change.

The exact period is determined in each case on the basis of the extent to which
the former code element was used.


[[reservation-exceptional]]
==== Exceptional reservations

Code elements may be reserved, in exceptional cases, for calendar systems and
calendar eras which the ISO 34300/AG has decided not to include in the lists
maintained by ISO 34300/RA, but for which an interchange or encoding requirement
exists.

==== Reallocation

Before reallocating a former code element or a formerly reserved code element,
the ISO 34300/AG shall consult, as appropriate, the authority or agency on whose
behalf the code element was reserved, and consideration shall be given to
difficulties which might arise from the reallocation.


==== User-assigned code elements

ISO 34300/RA and ISO 34300/AG do not keep a record of the notifications
concerning user-assigned code elements received.


==== List of reserved code elements

A list of reserved code elements is kept by the ISO 34300/RA.
