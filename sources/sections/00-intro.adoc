Calendar systems are essential to the tracking of dates and events.

Date and time tracking applications, such as in computing, archiving,
communication and bibliography, all depend on the accurate identification
of calendar systems for their performance. Moreover, accuracy of
date and time tracking is often paramount to important activities
from civilian to military use.

This document describes methods to unambiguously define calendar systems,
their properties, and provides a mechanism to assign unique identifiers
to these data elements.

This document also sets out the necessary procedures to maintain
an international registry of calendar systems.
